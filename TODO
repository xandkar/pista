### Runtime reconfiguration
On the second thought, this is an unnecessary complication. We can launch pista
through tmux (see example in pista-sensors repo), which gives us a convenient
way to reconfigure and restart pista without relaunching X.

The following have been scrapped:
- (needs ctrl) Runtime swap   slots
- (needs ctrl) Runtime remove slot
- (needs ctrl) Runtime add    slot
- (needs ctrl) Runtime config setting
- (id ctrl) Control FIFO and command interpreter
