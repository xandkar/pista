pista
=====

Piped-status bar.

Asynchronously reads lines from N FIFOs and routes to assigned slots on the bar.

Each slot is given a TTL, after which, if there was no update - the slot is
cleared - helping you spot broken sensors and not fool yourself with stale
data.

What is a sensor? What goes into a FIFO? Almost anything you want!

Some of the sensors I use can be found in the `pista-sensors` repository.

You would not be wrong to think of `pista` as `ii` for `dwm` status.


Usage
-----

See `demo` for a concrete, short, working example.

Intended for use with `dwm`, but can just as well be used for anything else
with a textual status area (like `tmux`).

For `dwm` there's an `-x` flag which causes the status to be sent directly to
the X11 root window name (which is what `dwm` uses as its status):

    pista -x a 10 15 b 20 5 &

For other things you'll need to route `pista`'s `stdout` output lines to the
desired location. Let's say `tmux` for example:

1. Run `pista` from somewhere (like `~/.xinitrc`):

    pista a 10 15 b 20 5 | while read line; do echo "$line" > ~/.status; done &

2. Then in `~/.tmux.conf`

    set -g status-right "#(cat ~/.status)"
