                      Piped Status: the ii of status bars!


DESCRIPTION
-----------

Intended for use with dwm, but can just as well be adopted to anything else
with a textual status area (like tmux).

Asynchronously reads lines from N FIFOs and routes to N corresponding slots on
the bar:

    b +--------------+--------------+- ... ---+-------------+
    a | slot_1       | slot_2       |         | slot_N      |
    r +--------------+--------------+- ... ---+-------------+
        ^              ^                        ^
        |              |                        |
       +-+            +-+                      +-+
       | |            | |                      | |
       |F|            |F|                      |F|
       |I|            |I|                      |I|
       |F|            |F|                      |F|
       |O|            |O|                      |O|
       | |            | |                      | |
       |1|            |2|                      |N|
       | |            | |                      | |
       +-+            +-+                      +-+
        ^              ^                        ^
        |              |                        |
    process_1      process_2           ...  process_N


Each slot is given a TTL, after which, if there was no update - the slot is
cleared - helping you spot broken sensors and not fool yourself with stale
data.

What is a sensor?
Any process that outputs lines of text.

What goes into a FIFO?
Lines of text. Each new line filling the slot corresponding to the sensor.


USAGE
-----

    pista [OPTION ...] SPEC [SPEC ...]

      SPEC       = FILE_PATH DATA_WIDTH DATA_TTL
      FILE_PATH  = string
      DATA_WIDTH = int    /* (positive) number of characters */
      DATA_TTL   = float  /* (positive) number of seconds */
      OPTION     = -i INTERVAL
                 | -s SEPARATOR
                 | -x     /* Output to X root window */
                 | -l LOG_LEVEL
                 | -e EXPIRY_CHARACTER
      SEPARATOR  = string
      INTERVAL   = float  /* (positive) number of seconds */
      LOG_LEVEL  = int    /* 0 (nothing)
                           * 1 (error)
                           * 2 (warn)
                           * 3 (info)
                           * 4 (debug)
                           */
      EXPIRY_CHARACTER = string  /* Character with which to fill the slot
                                  * upon expiration.
                                  */

EXAMPLES
--------

See demo file for a working example.

### dwm

For dwm there's an -x flag which causes the status to be sent directly to
the X11 root window name (which is what dwm uses as its status):

    pista -x a 10 15 b 20 5 &

### other

For other things you'll need to route pista's stdout output lines to the
desired location.

#### tmux

Let's say tmux for example:

1. Run pista from somewhere (like ~/.xinitrc):

    pista a 10 15 b 20 5 | while read line; do echo "$line" > ~/.status; done &

2. Then in ~/.tmux.conf

    set -g status-right "#(cat ~/.status)"
